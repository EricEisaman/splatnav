# Creation/Implementation Rules

## GitHub Account Requirement
- All GitHub CLI operations MUST use the EricEisaman account
- Verify GitHub CLI is authenticated as EricEisaman before any git/GitHub operations
- Use `gh auth status` to confirm the correct account is active

## TypeScript Standards
- NEVER use `any` type in TypeScript code
- NEVER use type casts or type assertions (e.g., `as Type`, `<Type>value`)
- Always use proper type definitions and type inference

## Code Restrictions
- NO timeouts: Do not use `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or any timeout/delay mechanisms
- NO logs: Do not use `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`, or any logging statements

## Implementation Phase Guidelines
- All code must strictly adhere to these rules
- Reject any code that violates these constraints
- Use proper TypeScript types and avoid workarounds that require type casting
- Find alternative solutions that don't require timeouts or logging

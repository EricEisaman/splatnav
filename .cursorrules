# CRITICAL: Read Rules Files Before Any Work

## MANDATORY FIRST STEP
Before creating any plan, implementing any code, or making any changes:
1. ALWAYS read `.cursor/rules/plan.mdc` for planning phase rules
2. ALWAYS read `.cursor/rules/create.mdc` for implementation phase rules
3. Verify compliance with ALL rules before proceeding

## Quick Rules Reference

### TypeScript Standards
- NEVER use `any` type in TypeScript code
- NEVER use type casts or type assertions (e.g., `as Type`, `<Type>value`)
- Always use proper type definitions and type inference

### Code Restrictions
- NO timeouts: Do not use `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or any timeout/delay mechanisms
- NO logs: Do not use `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`, or any logging statements

### GitHub Operations
- All GitHub CLI operations MUST use the EricEisaman account
- Verify GitHub CLI is authenticated as EricEisaman before any git/GitHub operations
- Use `gh auth status` to confirm the correct account is active

## Enforcement
- Flag any rule violations in the planning phase before implementation
- Reject any code that violates these constraints
- Find alternative solutions that comply with all rules

## Full Rules
See `.cursor/rules/plan.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/create.mdc` for complete details.
